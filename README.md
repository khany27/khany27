### Hi there, I am Salim ðŸ‘‹


I am a recent graduate and working currently with computer vision for autonomous driving. Check out my [Master Thesis](https://github.com/khany27/Object_Detection_Using_TensorFlow_1.15), where I have presented my thesis on road damage detection based on GPR and Deep learning models. It utilises TensorFlow Object Detection API and I have provided an easy tutorial to train a custom object detecotr on TensorFlow.

Currently, I am working with CenterNet, Yolov3 and Yolov5 on PyTorch on the same topic and on vechile and pedestrain detections. PyTorch provides great speed in running the inferences and hence my current project is to run the inference on an autonomous car to detect objects based on Camera and road damages based on GPR sensors.

### 1. Embedded Deep Learning based Semantic Segmentation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using TensorFLow Lite
<p align="justify">
This work explores the task of traffic scene segmentation using convolution neural network. The trained models are passed through 4 compression techniques (without quantization, Float16, Dynamic range, Int8) using TensorFlow Lite. The compression allows the model to achieve the maximum reduction of up to 91 percent with reduced noise.<br>

### 2. Behaviour based Control Strategy for Double Ackermann  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steering Control of Autonomous Tandem Road Rollers
<p align="justify">
The projects explores the trajectory tracking application for road rollers during edge compaction task. The roller receives path information from the paver through a remote interface. The algorithm extracts the edge spline of the path and then is offset to create a trajectory for the rollers to maneuvre. The behaviour based control strategy allows the rollers to switch to crab steering mode of the "Edge Compaction mode is activated. <br>

### 3. Multi-Robot Formation Control using Graph Theory

<p align="justify">
The project is an attempt to achieve the decentralized multi-robot formation control with the help of graph theory. In particular, we have studied different characteristics of multi-robot systems and formation control strategies associated with them. The project consists of of three experiments involving the square formation control of four unicycle robots using decentralized coordination. <br>
